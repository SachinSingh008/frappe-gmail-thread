## Frappe Gmail Thread

This app introduces Gmail thread tracking within Frappe by leveraging Gmail's Thread ID, enabling a more organized and seamless communication experience. Similar to Gmail's native threaded view, this feature groups related emails into cohesive conversations. Thread IDs are stored within Gmail Thread doctype designed specifically for threaded conversations. 

Additionally, Gmail thread can be associated with any doctype, such as Lead, Sales Orders or Tasks, to efficiently track email activity within specific documents.

#### Key Features and Capabilities
##### Send/Receive Emails:
Emails sent or received will automatically sync into ERPNext.
##### Link Threads to ERPNext Documents:
Associate Gmail threads with any doctype (e.g., Sales Order, Task) to track email activity directly within the document.
##### CC/BCC Functionality:
Emails with CC/BCC recipients allow all involved users to view and interact with the thread.
##### Attachments:
Email attachments are linked to the Gmail thread and are visible in the associated document's activity if the thread is linked.
##### Involving Additional Users:
Add users manually to the Involved User field within the Gmail Thread. These users can interact with the thread even if they werenâ€™t originally part of the email thread.
